// Package fleetping adds anonymous reports to FTW's daily fleet totals without
// telling the relay which box sent which report.
//
// It answers one question, and it is the owner's: how many households run FTW,
// on which version, with which drivers, so engineering effort lands where the
// fleet actually is. It runs against the constraint in docs/architecture.md:
// the daily totals must not give the relay a stable household record.
//
// So one ping is a picture of one box's shape and carries nothing that joins
// two pings together:
//
//   - no gateway ID, no site identity key, no Noise static key, no MAC, no
//     site name, no driver instance name, no serial and no hostname. Not
//     hashed, not truncated — absent. A hash of a stable value is a stable
//     value, and a salted one still matches itself tomorrow;
//   - no counter, no sequence number and no "last sent" time, because any of
//     them would let two pings be ordered into one box's series;
//   - buckets, not values. 12.4 kWh of battery and 197 days since install are
//     close to unique across a fleet this size; "5-15" and "6-12m" are not;
//   - a send time that moves. A box that pings at 03:17 every night has told
//     the endpoint its name in a field nobody thought to look at.
//
// What this cannot fix is the source IP, which the endpoint sees and which a
// household often keeps for months. That is the honest limit: this design
// makes the *payload* useless as an identifier, it does not make the
// connection anonymous. The drifting send time is what stops arrival time
// becoming a second selector alongside it — though the drift is a random walk
// in six-hour steps, so it takes about four days to spread across the clock,
// and until then one box's arrival times are still loosely related.
//
// The residual risk worth naming: the payload is still a quasi-identifier. A
// beta box in DK2 with 30+ kWh and an unusual driver pair may be the only one
// like it, and two such pings could be guessed to be the same box. Coarse
// buckets, a capped driver list and a small field set are what keep that
// population large; nothing here pretends it is a proof.
