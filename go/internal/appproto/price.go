// Prices: the box's side of the price window.
//
// The app has no HTTP origin — it reaches the box only over the session — so
// prices cross the wire like everything else. Two things happen here and
// nowhere else. Money becomes integer minor units, rounded once: the store
// keeps floats, the wire carries öre and cents, and rounding a second time
// somewhere else is how two screens start disagreeing about what 18.7 öre is.
// And an answer that does not cover the window asked for says so — whether it
// starts after the beginning, stops short of the end, or has a hole in the
// middle — because the app draws what it is given and would otherwise draw the
// gap as a market where prices simply stopped.

// maxPriceWindowMs bounds how much of the store one query may read.
//
// The prices table is never pruned — Prune ages the history tiers, not this —
// so it grows by about a hundred rows a day for the life of the box. A query
// with no upper bound is therefore a scan over years of rows, and on a Zap the
// memory that costs is memory local control needs. Eight days is more than
// anything asks for: a week of history and tomorrow's rates.
//
// This needs nobody to be malicious. The app derives its window from the
// phone's clock, so a device whose clock is wrong asks from 1970.

//
// fromMs and toMs are the window the caller asked for, and are what staleness
// is judged against: tomorrow's rates arrive in the afternoon, so a window
// asked for at breakfast genuinely ends early.
//
// Staleness covers the whole window, both edges and the middle — see below.

	// holding 00:00-06:00 and 12:00-24:00; a store that first heard from the
	// market at breakfast holds 06:00-24:00 of the day the app asked for from
	// midnight. A judgement that watches only the tail calls both a covered
	// day — so the app draws hours as a market that said nothing, which is
	// "never fake live" with prices in it.
	//

// the widest window the day-ahead market actually publishes — lands near 11 kB
// and fits; a week of them does not. The plan hit this exact wall and used to
// fail the encode, which killed the session and reached the user as "the box
// hangs up whenever I open the plan", so the rule here is the plan's rule:
// never error over size.
//
// What is dropped is the far end, and dropping it sets Stale. The near slots
// are the ones a person is planning around, and Stale already means "our
// numbers stop here" — the same sentence the box sends every morning before
// tomorrow's rates land. The app therefore needs no separate case for this,
// and can ask for the remainder as a second window if it wants it.
