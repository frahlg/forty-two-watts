// fleetCatalogue is where the set of "known" driver names comes from, and the
// point of it is to keep a household's own name for a driver out of that set.
//
// Two sources, and neither of them is "whatever is in this directory". A
// config field says where installed drivers are kept, so a directory is
// something the household can decide the contents of.
//
// The shipped catalogue is fleetping.ShippedCatalogue: generated from
// drivers/BUNDLED_SOURCE.json and compiled into the binary, so every box
// running this release has the same one and nothing on a running box can add
// to it. It used to be a scan of the directory the bundled drivers sit in,
// which was wrong: device_repository.root_dir is an ordinary config field, so
// pointing it inside that directory made every artifact the household had ever
// installed part of the shipped catalogue. A directory is something a config
// can point at; a generated constant is not.
//
// The driver-repository active dir is the other, and its listing decides
// nothing on its own. It holds one file per driver somebody installed, under
// whatever name the manifest that installed it gave, so every filename found
// there still has to answer: does this box's install history hold a record for
// that name saying it arrived under a signature made with FTW's own key? That
// is why root_dir may point anywhere at all — the listing only says which
// install records still have a file behind them, and an install record is not
// something a config writes.
//
// Only the name is matched here. That the file is still the artifact the
// record describes is settled before this runs, by driverrepo.reconcileActive:
// it drops any active entry that is not a symlink into the installed tree
// hashing to the recorded digest, and deactivates the record with it. So a
// household file left under an FTW-signed name is gone from both the directory
// and the history by the time the catalogue is read — which is worth knowing,
// because reading this function alone would suggest a name is all that is
// checked.
//
// The question is deliberately not asked of the config. The config is the
// household's to write, and it can be rewritten after the fact: an entry can
// claim a repository id the binary pins, be switched off, or be deleted
// outright while the file it installed stays where it is. Any of those turns
// "which repositories require a signature today" into an answer the household
// chose. What happened at install time is not theirs to rewrite, so that is
// what is read here — the flag driverrepo wrote on the install row.
//
// Anything with no such record reports as "other": a file copied into the
// active dir by hand, one renamed after it was installed, one from a
// repository of the household's own, and one installed before FTW started
// recording. That costs the box a name and nothing else.
